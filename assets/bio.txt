I am a pre-doctoral researcher at the Center for Applied AI (https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/center-for-applied-artificial-intelligence/about) at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. I earned a B.A. in Economics, summa cum laude, from the New Economic School (https://www.nes.ru/official&lang=en) and Higher School of Economics (https://www.hse.ru/en/info/). Before joining the Center for Applied AI, I worked as a data scientist at PLATA (https://www.linkedin.com/company/platacardmx).
