U.S. bank regulators generally view their role as overseeing banks' exposure to climate-related risks rather than actively shaping climate policy. However, the boundary between risk oversight and policy advocacy is a gray area. We examine how U.S. bank regulators respond to climate advocacy pressures by analyzing  textual data on public comments and comparing revisions between the draft and final interagency guidance on climate risk management. Utilizing large language models (LLMs) to classify the public comments, we find that these comments are highly polarized, with individuals and climate advocacy groups supporting climate action by bank regulators, and banks and banking associations opposing it. We create textual alignment measures between comments and the draft and final interagency guidance, and find that highly climate-engaged comments are less likely to be reflected in the final guidance, suggesting regulators discounted pro-climate advocacy. Finally, we leverage LLMs to simulate various roles for the regulator and find that policy revisions most similar to actual outcomes emerged when operating under financial stability mandates and partisan political framings.
