This paper explores the use and interpretation of ML methods in asset-pricing. First, I propose a robust market anomaly test based on analyst errors. I derive a link between excess returns and market's errors in earnings forecasts relative to a conditionally optimally estimator. I then contrast a Gradient Boosted Decision Tree algorithm to IBES consensus forecasts to show that companies for which analyst predictions exceeded ML forecasts earned lower out-of-sample returns and vice versa, which is consistent with the theoretical result. Further, I identify behavioral causes of analyst errors: I illustrate that analyst errors are associated with earnings growth in previous quarters (negatively), with book values (positively), and with capital expenditures (positively), thereby explaining some pricing anomalies. Second, I explore the application of ML for studying analyst behavior. I find that they submitted more Net Income forecasts for companies with intrinsically more predictable earnings as measured by R-Squared of ML forecasts after controlling for size and reporting history length.
