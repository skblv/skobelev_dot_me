This study examines the Bitcoin mining industry. It proposes a novel approach rooted in behavioral patterns for estimating the structure of the equipment utilized in the Bitcoin network. This study models industryâ€™s capital expenditures, aggregate efficiency of mining hardware, and aggregate miner profitability. It finds that profits cluster in time and are relatively low compared to pure Bitcoin returns. This study considers two Bitcoin valuation methods proposed earlier in the literature: the marginal cost of production approach and 51-percent attack arbitrage. The study finds that the marginal cost hypothesis is invalid, while 51-percent attack arbitrage theory is well-grounded. This study introduces the hashrate adjustment hypothesis, which states that miners in aggregate adjust network hashrate to their revenues, which are primarily a function of the price of Bitcoin. The study presents evidence in its support.
